        My name is Emily Gomez and I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from
        the University of Nebraska - Omaha in 2020. I had received minors in Studio Art and Mathematics as well.
        My focus is on front end development. I'm a quick learner and always willing to try new things.
        My favorite passtimes are traveling, cooking, and art.
